            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project seeks to raise awareness about the environment and why it's important for the future. Specifically, we will be learning about how to keep our Dublin High Community clean.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p><strong>Creating healthy and sustainable habits to better ourselves and the future!</strong></p>

            <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website:</strong> To raise awareness not just in our community but in many others.</li>
                <li><strong>Survey:</strong> We used a survey to gather information on what students believe to be the best methods to keep DHS clean.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>More trash cans:</strong> By increasing the amount of trash cans around the campus, it will increase the likelihood of someone actually throwing away their trash instead of leaving it somewhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encouraging students to help:</strong> DHS should implement a recycling and trash program where students can help keep the school clean. This help could count as volunteer hours for college applications, fostering team building and community awareness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reducing water waste:</strong> Fixing sinks and pipes to prevent water leakage can enhance existing sustainability efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Energy conservation:</strong> Solar panels are already present on parking lots, but adding more on rooftops and buildings would further conserve energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Promoting public transportation:</strong> Encouraging students to bike, walk, carpool, or take the bus to school will reduce carbon emissions and improve school traffic.
                </li>
